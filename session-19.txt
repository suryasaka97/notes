DRY --> don't repeat yourself

write a seperate file, create functions with all common code, call when required...

How can you call other scripts from current script

script-1.sh
script-2.sh

how you call script-2 from script-1

./script-2.sh
=========================
can't access scritp-1 variables
PID are different

source ./script-2.sh
=========================
same PID for both scripts
SCRIPT-2 can acess SCRIPT-1 variables
SCRIPT-1 can access SCRIPT-2 variables

for item in $@
do

done

item in $@ --> condition

while [ condition ];
do
    # statements
    # commands
done
