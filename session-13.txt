softlink/symlink hardlink and inode

shortcut(is also a file pointing real file) --> points to other real file
if I delete real file, shortcut will break

inode --> this is the metadata of the file

file permissions
ownership
size
original memory adress location of the file

symlink is like shortcut to original file. hardlink is like a copy of file. it is like backup
symlink and original file will have a diff inode. symlinks are used to point diff versions

ln -s <original-file> <symlink-file>

find / -name "*.conf"

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --> /etc/nginx-1.conf
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --> /etc/nginx-2.conf

dnf-4 install nginx -y

/usr/bin/dnf --> dnf-4


Symlink will have diff inodes, hardlinks will have same inode
if original file is deleted symlink will break. if original file deleted hard link will work
symlink is used to point diff versions, hardlink is used as backup to original file
symlink can be created to folders, we can't create hard link to folders
symlink will work with diff types of disks, hardlink can't be created for diff disks

memory troubleshooting
-------------------------
memory - RAM
storage - HD

swap memory is from HD as virtual RAM
HD --> RAM --> Programs

disk usage -> df -hT

du -sh <folder-path>
du -sh * --> all files and folders size will be displayed

/app --> /opt/app

/usr/share/nginx/html --> nginx root directory
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/bin/

/proc --> processes started by kernel
