 ✅ Corrected SSH `config` File (inside `~/.ssh/`):
```bash
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
`` 📌 Explanation:

- **`ServerAliveInterval 60`**  
  Sends a keepalive message every **60 seconds**.

- **`ServerAliveCountMax 3`**  
  If the server doesn’t respond **3 times in a row**, SSH will exit.

 **what's happening behind the scenes** when you create that `~/.ssh/config` file and add those lines.
---
### 🧠 What's Actually Happening in the Background:

#### Problem:
Your SSH session is **timing out** — usually because:
- There's **no activity**, and
- Network firewalls or NAT devices **drop idle connections**.

#### What the `~/.ssh/config` file does:
By adding this file with:
```bash
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```
You're telling your **SSH client** (your terminal) to do the following:

### 🧪 Behind the Scenes:

1. **Every 60 seconds**, your client sends a small "keepalive" message to the remote server (this is **not visible** to you).
   - This is done by `ServerAliveInterval 60`.

2. If the server doesn't respond **3 times in a row** (i.e., over 180 seconds), then your SSH session will close gracefully.
   - This is managed by `ServerAliveCountMax 3`.

3. These messages help **prevent idle SSH sessions from being killed** by firewalls or routers that think the connection is "dead."

---

### 🔁 In Summary:
- You’re **not changing the server** — you're configuring **your local SSH client** to actively keep the connection alive.
- It’s like tapping the server on the shoulder every minute saying: _“Hey, I’m still here.”_

### 📁 How to Create the Config File:

1. Go to your `.ssh` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
   ```

2. Create the file (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   touch config
   ```

3. Open it in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano config
   ```

4. Paste the corrected lines, save, and exit.

---

### 🔒 Optional: Set Proper Permissions
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```
This helps avoid SSH warnings about insecure file permissions.

Let's break down this line to understand the **file permissions, ownership, and what it tells us** about the `.ssh` directory inside your EC2 instance:
---
### 🧾 Example Output:
```bash
drwx------. 2 ec2-user ec2-user  29 May  2 07:21 .ssh
```
We'll break it into pieces:

### 📌 1. `drwx------.`

This is the **permission string**, and it's broken down like this:

| Character(s) | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `d`          | It's a **directory**. |
| `rwx`        | The **owner** (`ec2-user`) has **read, write, and execute** permissions. |
| `---`        | The **group** (`ec2-user`) has **no permissions**. |
| `---`        | **Others (everyone else)** have **no permissions**. |
| `.`          | Indicates **SELinux context** is applied (you can ignore it unless using SELinux). |

---

### 📌 2. `2`

This is the **link count**, meaning:
- This directory has **2 hard links** (normally one for the directory itself, and one for its parent reference `..`).

---

### 📌 3. `ec2-user ec2-user`

These are:
- **Owner**: `ec2-user`  
- **Group**: `ec2-user`

So both the file owner and the group are the same here.

---

### 📌 4. `29`

This is the **size** in bytes (29 bytes total for the `.ssh` folder metadata).

---

### 📌 5. `May  2 07:21`

This is the **last modified date/time** of the `.ssh` directory.

---

### 🔐 Why `.ssh` Should Have `700` Permissions:

The `.ssh` folder holds **sensitive key files**, so the permissions should always be strict:
```bash
drwx------ (700)
```

- Only the **owner** can enter/read/write the `.ssh` directory.
- **No other users** can view or access it — important for SSH security.

---

### ✅ Summary of Permissions in Numeric Form:

| Symbolic | Numeric | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `rwx------` | `700` | Only the user has full permissions. |
| `rw-------` | `600` | Used for private keys (`id_rsa`, etc.). |
| `rw-r--r--` | `644` | Used for public keys (`id_rsa.pub`, etc.). |

Certainly! Here's a structured summary of our **permission management** discussion so far:

---

### 📚 **File Ownership and Permissions in Linux**

1. **User & Group Basics**:
   - Every file in Linux has an **owner** and an associated **group**.
   - The owner is the **user** who created the file.
   - The group can be the user’s **primary group** (created when the user is created) or any other group the user belongs to.

---

### 🔑 **File Ownership Command**:
- **Check File Details**:  
  Use `ls -l` to see file details, including **owner** and **group**.
  ```bash
  ls -l myfile.txt
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  -rw-r--r-- 1 virat india 0 May 1 11:00 myfile.txt
  ```

  - `virat` is the **owner**.
  - `india` is the **group**.

---

### 🛠️ **Changing Ownership and Group**:
1. **Change Group Ownership**:
   - **Command**: `chgrp <group> <file>`
   - Changes the group associated with a file, even if the user is not part of that group.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     chgrp csk myfile.txt
     ```

2. **Change File Owner and Group**:
   - **Command**: `chown <owner>:<group> <file>`
   - Changes both **owner** and **group**.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     chown virat:csk myfile.txt
     ```

---

### 🔐 **Permissions**:
Permissions determine **who** can read, write, or execute a file.
- **File Permissions Format**: `rwxr-xr--`
   - **Owner**: `rwx` (read, write, execute)
   - **Group**: `r-x` (read, execute)
   - **Others**: `r--` (read-only)
   
  **Commands to modify permissions**:
   - **Give read/write/execute permissions**:  
     ```bash
     chmod 755 myfile.txt
     ```
   - **Breakdown**: `7` (rwx), `5` (r-x), `5` (r-x)

---

### 👥 **Group and Owner Relationship**:
- **By default**, the **owner** of a file is the user who created it.
- The **group** is usually the user’s **primary group**, but it can be any group the user belongs to.
- **Changing Group Ownership**:  
  You can change the group ownership of a file even if the **owner** is not part of that group, as long as you have the necessary permissions (like being root or the file owner).

---

### 🔄 **Can Group and Owner Be Unrelated?**:
- **Yes**, the **group** and **owner** of a file do **not have to be related**.
   - Example: `virat` can own a file, but the file can belong to the `csk` group (even if `virat` is not part of `csk`).

---

### 🔄 **Important Permission Scenarios**:
1. **Default File Creation**:  
   A file created by `virat` will belong to:
   - **Owner**: `virat`
   - **Group**: `india` (primary group of `virat`)

2. **Changing the Group of a File**:  
   You can use the `chgrp` command to change the group to any group on the system, even if the user is not a member of that group. For example:
   ```bash
   chgrp csk myfile.txt  # `virat` is not in `csk` group, but the group of the file will be `csk`
   ```

3. **Permissions for Group Members**:  
   - If a file belongs to a group that the user is **not part of**, the user **cannot access** the file unless the file's **permissions** allow it.
   - Example:  
     If `myfile.txt` has `r--` permissions for the group, only members of the group can **read** the file, not non-members.

---

### 📝 **Key Takeaways**:
- **`chgrp`** allows changing the group of a file.
- **`chown`** allows changing both the owner and the group.
- **Permissions** control what the owner, group, and others can do with a file.
- **Owner** and **group** do not have to be related by default, but the **permissions** and group membership determine access rights.

/etc/ssh/sshd_config

how can you give key based access to linux user?

ssh-keygen -f sivakumar

65,536 ports 0-65,535

1. create user
2. sivakumar can send his public key to admin user
3. /home/sivakumar admin creates .ssh in /home/sivakumar folder
4. sivakumar is the only owner to this folder... 700
5. create a file called authorized_keys with max access 600
6. admin keeps sivakumar public key here.
7. now sivakumar should be able to login
port is like flat number

ssh -i <key> ec2-user@IP

/etc/sudoers --> you can do changes to provide root access
or add user to wheel group without password
✅ Exactly right — that’s a **solid and scalable approach**.

Scenario where we need to give permission to 3 users and 5 group people

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step:

#### 1️⃣ **Create a Common Group**
```bash
sudo groupadd common_group
```

#### 2️⃣ **Add 3 Users to This Group**
These are **additional (secondary) groups** for the users:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG common_group user1
sudo usermod -aG common_group user2
sudo usermod -aG common_group user3
```

> 🔄 Use `groups user1` to verify membership.

#### 3️⃣ **Add Other Group Members**
If the 5 groups each have members who need access, **add those users individually** to the `common_group` as well:

```bash
# Add one member from each group
sudo usermod -aG common_group user_from_group1
sudo usermod -aG common_group user_from_group2
...
```

> 📌 You **cannot nest groups** in Linux. So users from other groups must be **manually added** to `common_group`.

#### 4️⃣ **Change Group Ownership of the File**
```bash
sudo chown root:common_group filename
```

#### 5️⃣ **Set Proper File Permissions**
```bash
chmod 660 filename   # read-write for owner and group, no access for others
```

### 🔐 Permissions Summary for `chmod 660`

| Role       | Permission |
|------------|------------|
| Owner (root)   | Read + Write |
| Group (common_group) | Read + Write |
| Others     | No access   |
