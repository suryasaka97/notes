chmod ugo+w devops.txt
chmod 700 devops.txt

only owner/root user can change the permissions

chown <user>:<group> devops.txt

file ownership can only be modified by root user
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

how can you give key based access to linux user?

ssh-keygen -f sivakumar

65,536 ports 0-65,535

1. create user
2. sivakumar can send his public key to admin user
3. /home/sivakumar admin creates .ssh in /home/sivakumar folder
4. sivakumar is the only owner to this folder... 700
5. create a file called authorized_keys with max access 600
6. admin keeps sivakumar public key here.
7. now sivakumar should be able to login
port is like flat number

ssh -i <key> ec2-user@IP

/etc/sudoers --> you can do changes to provide root access
or add user to wheel group without password
