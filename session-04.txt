## üßæ SSH Login via Password ‚Äì Step-by-Step Notes

### üîê By Default:
- Password-based SSH login is often **disabled** for security.

---

### ‚úÖ To Enable Password SSH Login:

1. **Edit SSH configuration file:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. **Modify or add these lines:**
```
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes   # only if root login is needed (optional & risky)
```

> üîí Best practice: keep `PermitRootLogin no` and use regular users with `sudo`.

3. **Check config syntax (optional but recommended):**
```bash
sudo sshd -t
```

- ‚úÖ No output = syntax is valid.
- ‚ùå Output = fix the error shown.

4. **Restart SSH service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

5. **(Optional) Set a password for the user:**
```bash
sudo passwd your_user
```

6. **Connect via SSH from client machine:**
```bash
ssh your_user@<external_ip>
```
