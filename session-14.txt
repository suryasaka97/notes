1. time
2. human errors

100 logs carry from farm to home

all commands keep it in file, run it as a file(Coding)

if I run a command --> I have common sense, I can understand whether it is success or not...

variables
data types
functions
conditions
loops
error handling

90% design + 10% coding

Coding
1. programming --> developers. data strcuture, alogorithms, design patterns
				   less resources(RAM, CPU, HD), less time
2. scripting --> DevOps. simple scripting

shell vs python
===============
UI --> Shell/CMD --> Kernel
UI --> Python --> Shell/CMD --> Kernel

shell is native in Linux. If you want any automation inside linux server, shell is the perfect choice.
python is useful when you are interacting with other/external systems.

keep code in version control/source code management(SCM)

1. security
2. tough to share the code
3. no versions

Centralised vs Distributed
====================
google drive --> 10 members
open google docs in browser, do the change

donwload the doc in local laptop, open in word do the changes then upload to drive

SVN vs Git(GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.)

IDE(Integrated development env) --> vscode, eclipse, intellij, sublime, etc.

1. create repo in github
2. clone/download the repo
3. add to staging/temp area.
4. commit
5. push changes

git add . ; git commit -m "message"; git push origin main
. means all the changes

sh <script-name>
#!/bin/bash --> shebang, it should be the first line in shell script, it is the interpeter to check the syntax and execute the commands..

sh == bash

x=0, y=1, z=3
solve the expression and finally substitute variables

label --> item
key=value

variable is a container to hold the value, you can use it wherever you require. and this centralised, if you change at once place it will reflect wherever you use. DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

args/arguments

sh 04-variables.sh value1 value2
$1=value1
$2=value2

Data Types
=================
int i=0
float
double
decimal
string
char
boolean
array arraylist set map

$NAME == ${NAME}
